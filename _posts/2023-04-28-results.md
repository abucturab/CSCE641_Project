## EG3D Results

Single Scene Overfitting, where 3d reconstruction of a single object takes place.

Below are the snapshots of the object from multiple angles

[COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io/tutorial.html#structure-from-motion)  reconstructed 3D mesh from point cloud

## NeRF Results

Coarse sampling of the Rays -
64 samples per ray

Fine Sampling of the Rays - 
This uses hierarchical sampling as implemented in the Original paper

## Analysis
The performance of EG3D is far better compared to the NeRF model (for whatever duration it has been trained on) as can be seen by the following side by side comparison.

| Model | Time | Epoch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EG3D | 1-2 days on a trained Tri-plane | 200K |
| NeRF | 3-4 days | 2K |
